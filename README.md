A simple and efficient Python script to extract frames from a video file using `ffmpeg`.

## Prerequisites

- **ffmpeg**: Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed on your system. You can check if itâ€™s installed by running `ffmpeg -version` in the terminal. If it's not installed, download it from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- **ffmpeg-python**: Install the `ffmpeg-python` library:
  ```bash

  pip install ffmpeg-python

## Usage
Save the script below to a file, for example, extract_frames.py.

Make the script executable (optional but recommended on Unix-like systems):

  ```bash
chmod +x extract_frames.py

```
To run the script:
Open a terminal (eg. osx terminal), type python3 (including the space), drag your script in, then drag your video file into the terminal to add their paths in automatically. Press Enter to run the script. It should look something like below:

```bash

python3 /path/to/extract_frames.py /path/to/your/video.mp4

```
